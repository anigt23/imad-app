    <p>
    Hey there! This page covers my complete minimalist travel guide. I'll share my exact system for packing light, my favorite pieces of ultralight travel gear, and my thoughts on why it is always better to travel the world with just one bag.
    </p>
    <p>
    I have traveled to more than 25 countries so far. Along the way, I have slowly optimized and improved my packing list and travel strategy. Even if you're not interested in traveling as light as I do, I think you'll find this guide useful. My hope is that this packing list will help you eliminate the unnecessary items that we often drag around on our travels, but never actually use.</p>

    <p>
        Before we dive into my full list, I think it is important to note that I began traveling long before I had any of the items listed here. You don't need any of the items on this page to travel (although many of them will make your life easier). The only thing you need to travel is the courage to explore.
